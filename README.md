# CPR-vCodex Steroids

> **CPR-vCodex Steroids** is a personal fork of **CPR-vCodex** that layers additional UI features, experimental subsystems, and distinct branding on top of the stable vCodex baseline. It targets the Xteink X4 (ESP32-C3) and maintains full compatibility with the vCodex reading analytics, highlights, dictionaries, and flashcards while adding a richer launcher, plugin system, and streaming statistics architecture.
>
> Unlike the conservative vCodex approach of only carrying forward stable upstream changes, Steroids intentionally integrates larger architectural rewrites (streaming stats loader, Library V3 mixed view, declarative fast restart) and entirely new subsystems (Lua plugin VM, offline Wikipedia, screensaver) that are feature-complete but may carry higher merge risk. The firmware remains fast and stable for daily reading, with RAM/Flash budgets respected.
>
> The philosophy: **keep the vCodex reading experience intact, extend the device capabilities for power users.**

## What's different in this fork

My goal with this fork was to preserve CrossPoint experience while expanding the firmware around long-term reading engagement and personalization.

Unlike a complete rewrite, CPR-vCodex intentionally stays close to the upstream CrossPoint project and only carries forward additions or upstream changes that are stable and safe enough for daily reading.

Some of the main additions include:

- full reading analytics: reading stats, heatmaps, day detail, reading profile, session history, goals, streaks, and achievements
- Sync Day support for reliable offline day-based statistics on hardware without a trustworthy sleep RTC
- per-book statistics tools, including reading-time correction, start-date editing, and per-book stats reset
- StarDict dictionary support from the SD card, with selectable monolingual and translation dictionaries, per-language folders, reader word lookup, suggestions, and lookup history
- offline Flashcards with CSV decks, multiple study modes, recents, stats, and session summaries
- unified EPUB Highlights for selected text and saved pages, with a global Highlights app and backward-compatible bookmark storage
- repagination-resistant EPUB page marks and highlights, stored with visible-text anchors in BookmarkStore v5 while retaining v1-v4 migration
- highlight matching that survives layout-inserted hyphens, split ellipses, and non-breaking-space fragments without confusing authored hyphens
- customizable Home and Apps shortcuts, reader quick settings, reading layouts, themes, and Lyra Carousel workflow improvements
- enhanced sleep tools, including custom image directories, cover/custom stats screens, sleep previews, cached sleep frames, and configurable clean sleep refresh
- downloadable and manually installable SD-card fonts, including vCodex families such as `ChareInk` and `Lexend`
- improved EPUB image handling for packed low-depth PNGs, scaled images and SVG image references, with low-memory band rendering and decode placeholders
- native EPUB ruby annotations for Chinese/Japanese reading aids, improved CJK line breaking, and SD-font CJK fallback for book lists and chapter titles
- Screen Clean, SD firmware update, Auto Flash, reading stats editor, and other maintenance/workflow utilities
- named KOReader Sync profiles with optional metadata, ask/smart synchronization behavior and per-profile account registration
- OPDS filename options, reader refresh controls, Bionic Reading, text darkness, dark mode, and other reader quality-of-life settings
- carefully selected upstream CrossPoint improvements and fixes adapted without dropping vCodex-specific behavior

The philosophy of this fork is simple: keep the firmware fast, stable, and focused on reading, while making the device feel more rewarding and personal for people who read every day.

## EPUB images in 1.6.0.38

EPUB diagrams and gray backgrounds now retain their gray levels when text
anti-aliasing is disabled ([#215](https://github.com/franssjz/cpr-vcodex/issues/215)).
Progressive JPEGs with separate component scans are also corrected using
CrossPoint's #2925 fix. Existing image caches and settings remain valid.
The image changes passed simulator regressions and tests against the actual
JPEG decoder. The development build booted twice on X4; the two reported
EPUBs still need visual confirmation on the physical screen.

## OTA shows 0 B / 0% — recovery status

CPR-vCodex 1.6.0.31 through 1.6.0.33 can find a new release but fail before
receiving firmware bytes ([#219](https://github.com/franssjz/cpr-vcodex/issues/219)).
Version 1.6.0.37 still had a separate update-check failure: on X4, HTTPS
certificate signature verification could run out of memory while Settings
remained on the activity stack. Version 1.6.0.38 adapts CrossInk's fresh network
boot: opening Update briefly shows Loading, then opens the updater with a clean
heap and without SD reader fonts. It retains certificate verification.
A successful check shows the installed and published versions;
an equal or newer installed version is reported as up to date. A failed network
or manifest check is reported separately and can be retried. The updater also
retries the certificate-verified manifest through GitHub's raw host if Pages fails.

An installed updater cannot acquire a client-side fix through a download path
that consistently fails on that device. For an affected reader, the existing
alternative is to upload the published X3/X4 release BIN using
`File Transfer > Join Network`, then install it with
`Settings > System > SD Card Firmware Update`. Use the exact C3 release asset
and keep the reader powered throughout validation and installation. This path
does not require USB flashing or removing the microSD card.

Do not substitute an X4 Pro binary. X4 Pro distribution remains withdrawn.
Keep `/.crosspoint` (settings, progress and statistics) intact. A general
factory reset or downgrade is not the remedy for this transport failure.

The repaired updater obtains the expected SHA-256 over certificate-verified
HTTPS and checks the downloaded size, digest, chip and image before selecting
the inactive OTA partition. Automated fault-injection tests verify activation
policy; they do not replace an end-to-end transfer and reboot on X3 and X4.

## Froze in Update Complete (Soft Bricked?) — X3 recovery

Some USB-locked Xteink X3 units with the newer UC8279d display controller appeared to remain frozen on the previous or `Update Complete` screen after installing older CPR-vCodex releases. The device was not actually bricked: the firmware continued running, but the unsupported display controller prevented the screen from refreshing.

Affected users have successfully recovered devices running CPR-vCodex `1.5.0.3` and `1.5.0.9` by blindly opening the SD firmware updater and installing `1.5.0.22`, which detects both the original UC8253 and newer UC8279d X3 panels at boot.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This emergency procedure is intended for an X3 whose display is already frozen on an older CPR-vCodex release. Do not use the blind sequence for a normally working device; use the visible `Settings > System > SD Card Firmware Update` flow instead. Back up the card first or use a separate clean FAT32 recovery card, and do not interrupt the device or remove the microSD while firmware validation or flashing is in progress.

- [XTEINK X3 — vCodex Unfreeze procedure (PDF)](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/31417306/XTEINK.X3.-.vCodex.Unfreeze.procedure.pdf) consolidates the physical-button sequence, required waits, SD-card preparation, and final confirmation used for the successful recoveries.
- [Froze in Update Complete (Soft Bricked?) — issue #193](https://github.com/franssjz/cpr-vcodex/issues/193) contains the complete investigation and the step-by-step discussion with affected users, including their questions, screenshots, clarifications, and successful recovery reports.

## Web tools

- [Auto Flash](https://franssjz.github.io/cpr-vcodex/flash.html) installs the latest CPR-vCodex firmware on the Xteink X4 and X3 from Chrome or Edge using Web Serial. X4 is always the default. X4 Pro remains visibly marked as withdrawn, but the page cannot select, download, or flash it—even if an obsolete manifest is cached.
- [Reading Stats Editor](https://franssjz.github.io/cpr-vcodex/reading-stats-editor/) edits exported reading stats locally in the browser. No upload, no server.
- Device web settings treat the KOReader password as write-only: the stored value is never returned to the browser, which only indicates that a password is already configured.

## SD card DICTIONARIES

`CPR-vCodex` can use StarDict-format dictionaries stored on the microSD card. Dictionary data stays on the SD card; after a dictionary is selected, the firmware creates a small `.cpridx` cache next to it so later lookups stay fast.

Important: a loose `.dict` file is not enough. The dictionary must be a complete StarDict package with matching `.ifo`, `.idx`, and uncompressed `.dict` files using the same base filename.

Recommended microSD layout:

```text
SD:/
  dictionaries/
    spanish/
      es-es.ifo
      es-es.idx
      es-es.dict
      es-es.syn        # optional synonym/headword file
      es-es.cpridx     # generated by CPR-vCodex; do not copy manually
    english-spanish/
      en-es.ifo
      en-es.idx
      en-es.dict
```

Each language or dictionary group lives in `dictionaries/<language>/`. The directory name is the visible language/group label, so names such as `spanish`, `english`, `english-spanish`, or `en-es` are all valid. Each directory may contain one or more dictionaries.

The root folder is resolved case-insensitively, so `/Dictionaries`, `/DICTIONARIES`, and `/dictionaries` all work; CPR-vCodex keeps using the exact capitalization already present on the card.

For every StarDict dictionary, the required files are:

- `<name>.ifo`: dictionary metadata, including name, word count, and format hints.
- `<name>.idx`: word index; it maps each headword to the byte offset of its definition.
- uncompressed `<name>.dict`: definition data.

Optional files:

- `<name>.syn` enables alternate headwords and synonym redirects when the dictionary provides them.
- `<name>.cpridx` is generated by CPR-vCodex after preparing the dictionary and should not be downloaded or copied by hand.
*All files with the same name.

Compressed `<name>.dict.dz` dictionaries are detected but are not currently supported directly. If the downloaded package contains a `.dict.dz` file, open or extract it first and copy the resulting uncompressed `.dict` file to the SD card. The valid format for CPR-vCodex is `.dict`, not compressed `.dict.dz`.

Use on the Xteink:

1. Copy the dictionary files to `dictionaries/<language>/` on the microSD card.
2. Reinsert the card and open `Apps > Dictionary`.
3. Choose the definition text size. `Medium` is the default.
4. Select the dictionary to prepare and activate it. Depending on the dictionary size, the first activation can take several seconds while CPR-vCodex builds its lookup cache.
5. While reading an EPUB, open the reader menu to use `Look up word`, `Lookup history`, or `Dictionary` to change the active dictionary/configuration and return to the book.

Dictionary download sources vary in quality, completeness, format, and license. Always extract the downloaded package until you have the `.ifo`, `.idx`, and `.dict` files, and check the license before redistributing a dictionary.

Monolingual (Defining) dictionary:
- [Monolingual dictionaries adapted for CPR-vCodex](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/xistn8eurgvih/xteink#7ox8nert1gl68) includes several monolingual dictionaries adapted for cpr-vcodex.

Bilingual (Translation) dictionary:
- [Bilingual dictionaries adapted for CPR-vCodex](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/xistn8eurgvih/xteink#jdlxf65m3l4c3) includes several bilingual dictionaries adapted for cpr-vcodex.
- [WikDict StarDict downloads](https://download.wikdict.com/dictionaries/stardict/) includes translation dictionaries such as German-English and English-German, depending on the published package. Includes several StarDict packages. Extract packages until you have matching `.ifo`, `.idx`, and uncompressed `.dict` files.

If you know reliable public dictionary links for more languages, please contact the project or open an issue/discussion so this list can be updated.

## SD card fonts

`CPR-vCodex` supports extra `.cpfont` families stored on the microSD card. The built-in reader fonts still work as usual, and downloaded SD fonts such as Lexend appear in `Settings > Reader > Font Family` after the firmware discovers them.

Font discovery is lazy while the built-in font is selected, and the active SD font plus its catalog are released before Wi-Fi startup to leave more contiguous RAM for the radio. Both `/.fonts` and `/fonts` are resolved case-insensitively, including installs and deletion.

SD-card font rendering keeps a fast per-glyph advance cache when it is complete, and falls back to direct glyph measurement when an external font cache is missing an entry. Browser File Transfer downloads also preserve the advertised response size so downloaded files do not fail with content-length mismatch errors.

CJK-capable families can also provide 8, 10, and 12 pt files. CPR-vCodex uses those as size-matched fallbacks for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean text in the File Browser, Recent Books, and EPUB chapter list, and preloads each visible screen in one SD pass to avoid per-glyph reads.

The File Transfer EPUB optimizer includes an optional `Remove embedded fonts` advanced setting. It is off by default so the optimized book remains portable to readers that honor publisher fonts; enabling it removes font files, matching OPF/encryption entries, and `@font-face` rules because CPR-vCodex renders with its selected built-in or SD-card font.

Device download:

1. Connect the reader to Wi-Fi.
2. Open `Settings > Reader > Manage Fonts`.
3. Select a family and download it.
4. Return to `Reader Font Family` and choose the newly installed font.

Manual install from GitHub is faster when Wi-Fi on the device is slow. The CPR-vCodex package contains
vCodex-specific additions; use the CrossPoint source/package for other common families:

1. Download [`all-fonts.zip`](https://github.com/franssjz/cpr-vcodex/releases/download/sd-fonts-m1-b4/all-fonts.zip) from the latest CPR-vCodex SD font package.
2. Extract it into the root of the microSD card. The archive creates `fonts/<Family>/*.cpfont`.
3. Reinsert the card, restart the device, and select the font under `Settings > Reader > Font Family`.

Manual single-family install also works. Download all `.cpfont` files for a family from [`sd-fonts-m1-b4`](https://github.com/franssjz/cpr-vcodex/releases/tag/sd-fonts-m1-b4), create `fonts/<Family>/` on the microSD card, and copy the matching files there.

Recommended microSD layout:

```text
SD:/
  fonts/
    ChareInk/
      ChareInk_12.cpfont
      ChareInk_14.cpfont
      ChareInk_16.cpfont
      ChareInk_18.cpfont
    Lexend/
      Lexend_10.cpfont
      Lexend_12.cpfont
      Lexend_14.cpfont
      Lexend_16.cpfont
      Lexend_18.cpfont
```

## Flashcards study modes

`Flashcards` currently offers four review modes:

- `Due`: builds a finite session from cards that are due first, then fills with unseen cards if needed. `Session size` is respected here, and `All` means "all due cards plus unseen cards".
- `Scheduled`: builds a finite shuffled session from the whole deck. `Session size` is respected here, and `All` means the whole deck.
- `Infinite`: ignores `Session size`, keeps drawing cards from the whole deck, and never finishes on its own. Exit manually when you want the session summary.
- `Sequential`: uses every card in CSV order, ignores `Session size`, and finishes after the last card.

Why it is split this way:

- `Study mode` decides **which cards** enter the session
- `Session size` decides **how many** of those cards are included

`Fail` and `Next` send the current card back through the session flow. In `Infinite`, the queue is rebuilt again when a full pass is consumed, so practice can continue indefinitely. In `Sequential`, the deck is kept in file order.

Example CSV deck structure:

```csv
front,back
"What is the capital of France?","Paris"
"Who wrote Don Quixote?","Miguel de Cervantes"
"What is 12 x 12?","144"
```

Sample deck ready to copy to the SD card:

`CPR-vCodex` is a reading-focused firmware fork for the **Xteink X4**, built on top of the stable **CrossPoint Reader** baseline and extended with analytics, reader utilities, branding cleanup, extra UI features, and carefully selected upstream carry-forwards.

The official `crosspoint-reader` project is treated as the stable reference. `vcodex` only carries forward upstream work when it is useful on the X4 and safe enough to keep the reader fast and reliable.

There may be some **involuntary or incidental X3 compatibility** because parts of the upstream codebase still carry X3-aware paths. `CPR-vCodex` now also includes an **experimental X3-only tilt page-turn option** for devices with the QMI8658 IMU, but it is hidden when the sensor is not detected and remains off by default. The firmware is still developed and validated on **X4**, and I do **not** currently have an **X3** device available to test or confirm that compatibility.

This project is **not affiliated with Xteink**.

## Highlights

- stable upstream-based reader baseline kept fast on large EPUBs
- richer on-device analytics: `Reading Stats`, `Reading Heatmap`, `Reading Day`, `Reading Profile`
- manual per-book reading-time/date corrections for missed or accidental stats
- `Achievements` built on top of the same reading data model
- `Sync Day` for coherent day-based stats on hardware without a trustworthy sleep RTC
- `Lyra Carousel` Home theme, originally created by [zgredex](https://github.com/zgredex), adapted to this fork by [erickosanchezj](https://github.com/erickosanchezj), limited to 3 books for smoother X4 navigation, with a sliding bottom shortcut row so every configured Home action remains reachable
- experimental X3-only `Tilt Page Turn`, hidden unless the QMI8658 IMU is detected and disabled by default
- downloadable SD-card fonts from CrossPoint plus vCodex families such as `ChareInk` and `Lexend`
- SD-card firmware update from Settings for local `.bin` flashing without a browser
- configurable long-press side-button behavior: `Off`, `Chapter skip`, or `Orientation change`
- EPUB Highlights for selected text and saved pages, plus a global Highlights app
- context-aware screenshot filenames that include the current book title when available
- KOReader Sync compatibility improvements, including Calibre-Web-Automated `/kosync` support
- configurable OPDS download filename format: `Author - Title` or `Title - Author`
- configurable `Home` and `Apps` shortcuts
- `Flashcards` with offline CSV decks, session summary, recents, stats and settings
- `Text Darkness`, `Bionic Reading`, `Reader Refresh Mode`, downloadable `Lexend`, `X Small`
- `Sleep` tools with directory selection, preview, cache, sequential and shuffle behavior
- `Dark Mode (Experimental)`
- Vietnamese UI support and synchronized translation coverage across all shipped languages

## Languages

`CPR-vCodex` currently ships with **23 UI languages**:

- English
- Spanish
- French
- German
- Czech
- Portuguese
- Russian
- Swedish
- Romanian
- Catalan
- Ukrainian
- Belarusian
- Italian
- Polish
- Finnish
- Danish
- Dutch
- Turkish
- Kazakh
- Hungarian
- Lithuanian
- Slovenian
- Vietnamese

The translation set is maintained from `english.yaml` as the source of truth. Current shipped UI keys are synchronized across all 23 languages; safe English fallback remains available for future keys that have not been translated yet.

## Easy installation

For most users, this is the easiest way to install the firmware:

1. Download the latest `*-cpr-vcodex.bin` release file.
2. Turn on and unlock your Xteink X4.
3. Open [xteink.dve.al](https://xteink.dve.al/).
4. In `OTA fast flash controls`, select the firmware file.
5. Click `Flash firmware from file`.
6. Select the device when the browser asks.
7. Wait for the installation to finish.
8. Restart the device if needed.

To return to the original CrossPoint Reader later, repeat the same process with the original firmware file.

## 5-minute start

If you just flashed `CPR-vCodex` and want the main value quickly:

1. Open `Home > Sync Day`
2. Connect to Wi-Fi and sync the date
3. Open a book and read normally
4. Open `Apps > Reading Stats`
5. Open `Apps > Reading Heatmap`

That is enough to start using the core `vcodex` additions: coherent day-based analytics, better stats visibility, and improved app-level reading tools.

## Home and Apps

The launcher is split into `Home` and `Apps`.

`Home` stays focused on frequently used reading entry points, while `Apps` collects the richer tools added by the fork.

Notable launcher behavior:

- shortcut placement can be moved between `Home` and `Apps`
- shortcut visibility can be toggled
- ordering is configurable
- stats-related shortcuts show useful live metadata
- `Apps` paginates long lists and supports page-jump navigation
- `Lyra Carousel` is available as an optional cover-focused Home theme and is limited to 3 books for smoother X4 navigation; its bottom shortcut row shows five icons at a time but scrolls laterally with selection so longer Home shortcut lists remain reachable
  It was originally created by [zgredex](https://github.com/zgredex) and adapted to CPR-vCodex by [erickosanchezj](https://github.com/erickosanchezj).

Management lives in:

- `Settings > Apps > Location Home and Apps`
- `Settings > Apps > Visibility Home and Apps`
- `Settings > Apps > Order Home shortcuts`
- `Settings > Apps > Order Apps shortcuts`

## Sync Day and date model

This part matters, because several `vcodex` features depend on day-level data.

The ESP32-C3 in the X4 does not provide a sleep-resilient real-time clock you can trust after every sleep cycle. So the fork uses a practical model:

1. `Sync Day` connects over Wi-Fi and gets a valid date/time using NTP
2. that becomes the trusted reference date for stats
3. if the live clock later becomes unreliable, the firmware falls back to the last valid saved date
4. day-based views stay coherent instead of drifting randomly

In practice:

- syncing once per day before reading is usually enough
- day-based stats depend on having a valid day reference
- timezone and date format are configurable globally

## Reading analytics suite

All reading analytics features share the same persistence model and data source.

That means these views stay coherent with each other:

- `Reading Stats`
- `Reading Heatmap`
- `Reading Day`
- `Reading Profile`
- per-book stats detail

### What gets tracked

- started books
- finished books
- total reading time
- daily reading time
- counted sessions
- daily-goal progress
- goal streak and max streak
- per-book progress and last-read state

### Important rules

- a session counts only after reaching the minimum tracked duration
- daily goal is configurable
- day-based analytics depend on a valid synced or recovered day
- books under ignored stats paths are excluded from tracking

### Main views

| View | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Reading Stats` | main analytics hub with goal, streak, totals and started books |
| `More Details` | wider trends and graphs |
| `Reading Heatmap` | monthly calendar of reading intensity |
| `Reading Day` | one-day detail view opened from the heatmap |
| `Reading Profile` | summary of recent reading behavior |
| `Per-book stats detail` | cover, progress, sessions, time and last-read info for one book |

Per-book detail also includes a small settings button under the cover. It opens book-specific stats actions:

- `Adjust reading time` opens the correction screen for missed or accidental reading time
- `Modify start date` changes only the book's displayed start date metadata
- `Reset this book's stats` asks for confirmation, then removes that book's stats entry, attributed session history, and rebuilds aggregate reading totals

The correction screen can:

- choose `Add` or `Subtract`
- choose the exact date with the same numeric picker style used by `Sync Day`
- choose 15, 30, 45, or 60 minutes
- subtracting is capped so a day can never go below zero

Manual corrections update the same daily totals used by streaks, heatmaps and achievements.

## Achievements

`Achievements` adds a lightweight progression layer on top of the same reading data used by stats.

It provides:

- a dedicated `Apps > Achievements` screen
- pending vs completed sections
- unlock popups
- reset support
- retroactive sync from existing reading stats

The current catalog rewards, among other things:

- started books
- counted sessions
- finished books
- total reading time
- goal-completion days
- streaks
- bookmark usage
- long sessions

## ReadMe

`ReadMe` is an on-device quick guide for the main fork features.

It includes compact help pages for:

- `Sync Day`
- `Reading Stats`
- `Bookmarks`
- `Flashcards`
- `Sleep`
- `Customize Home and Apps`
- `Achievements`
- `If found, please return me`

This gives device-side help without needing to reopen GitHub every time.

## If found, please return me

This app is a simple lost-device return screen.

How it works:

- open `Apps > If found, please return me`
- the screen always shows a fixed intro message
- if `/if_found.txt` exists on the SD root, its content is shown below
- common filename/encoding variants are tolerated, including case differences, `if_found.txt.txt`, UTF-8 BOM, and UTF-16 text files
- if the file does not exist, the app shows a fallback message explaining how to create it

## Highlights

Highlights are implemented for EPUB as one feature with two entry types:

- text highlights for a selected phrase
- page marks, preserving the behavior and data of the previous Bookmarks feature

Supported flow:

- open the reader menu and choose `Highlight text`; select the first and last word, then save
- long-press `Select` inside EPUB reading to toggle a page mark
- use `Save page mark` when the current page should be kept without toggling it
- open `View highlights` or the global `Apps > Highlights` screen to browse both types together
- reopen a book at the saved page and delete individual entries or all highlights for one book

Existing `bookmarks.bin` files remain readable. They are upgraded in place only when
the user next changes the book's Highlights, and all old bookmarks become page-mark
entries rather than being discarded. Format v5 adds a visible Unicode-codepoint anchor
to new page marks and text highlights, so reopening them remains tied to the same content
after changing font size, margins, line spacing, or orientation.

Highlights also recognize words split by a layout-inserted hyphen and adjacent ellipsis/NBSP fragments after reflow. A hyphen authored in the EPUB remains part of the text and is never silently discarded by matching.

The text-selection and on-page highlighting behavior is adapted from
[CrossInk](https://github.com/uxjulia/CrossInk) by
[Julia Nguyen (`uxjulia`)](https://github.com/uxjulia), beginning with CrossInk
commit [`b4d0ee1`](https://github.com/uxjulia/CrossInk/commit/b4d0ee190480fb3c9a175f09daab9dede3ca467a)
and incorporating relevant later robustness fixes through
[`ffda6de`](https://github.com/uxjulia/CrossInk/commit/ffda6de71554a53f60b861ef08ad6770426b4ac5).

## Flashcards

`Flashcards` is an offline study app built around CSV decks on the SD card.

Main sections:

- `Open`
- `Recents`
- `Statistics`
- `Settings`

Deck flow:

- open a CSV deck from the SD card
- study in landscape using `Flip`, `Next`, `Success` and `Fail`
- leave the deck through the page buttons when you want to finish
- get a session summary when you exit

Study modes:

- `Due`: finite review-oriented session, using due cards first and unseen cards second
- `Scheduled`: finite shuffled session from the whole deck
- `Infinite`: endless practice, ignores `Session size`
- `Sequential`: whole deck in CSV order, ignores `Session size`

Statistics:

- each deck keeps its own seen / unseen / due / mastered metrics
- `Statistics` lists known decks
- holding `Select` on a deck inside `Statistics` lets you reset that deck's flashcard stats after confirmation

## Sleep

The `Sleep` app makes custom sleep images easier to manage.

It supports:

- directory discovery
- preview
- sequential vs shuffle order
- persistent selected directory
- case-insensitive default folders such as `/Sleep`, `/sleep`, and `/.Sleep`
- cached sleep framebuffers
- reduced repetition through recent-wallpaper tracking
- `Reading Dashboard` sleep mode with daily goal, streak, reading totals, and achievement progress
- `Cover + Stats` and `Custom + Stats` sleep modes with compact reading overlays on either the current cover or configured custom images

## Settings

The most important fork-specific options are concentrated in `Settings > Apps`, while reader and display behavior stay under the normal settings categories.

Useful reader/display additions include:

| Area | Options |
|---|---|
| Reader | `Text Anti-Aliasing`, `Text Darkness`, `Bionic Reading`, `Reader Refresh Mode`, `Reader Font Family`, `Reader Font Size`, `Manage Fonts` |
| Display | `UI Theme`, sleep-screen controls, `Dark Mode (Experimental)`, `Sunlight Fading Fix` |
| Controls | `Side Button Layout`, `Long-press button behavior`, `Short Power Button Click`, `Tilt Page Turn` |
| Status bar | EPUB/status-bar fields, battery visibility, `XTC Status Bar` |
| System | `Hide File Extension`, `SD Card Firmware Update`, OTA update check, cache clearing, language, OPDS servers |
| Date | `Display Day`, `Date Format`, `Time Zone`, `Sync Day` reminder behavior |
| Reading stats | `Daily Goal`, `Show after reading`, `Reset Reading Stats`, `Export Reading Stats`, `Import Reading Stats` |
| Achievements | `Enable achievements`, `Achievement popups`, `Reset achievements`, `Sync with prev. stats` |
| Navigation | `Location Home and Apps`, `Visibility Home and Apps`, `Order Home shortcuts`, `Order Apps shortcuts` |

`Text Darkness` is a feature idea seen in the `crosspet` fork and adapted here for `vcodex`.

Font notes:

- `Bookerly` and `Noto Sans` have full regular/bold/italic coverage in the compiled sizes
- `Lexend` is available as a downloadable SD-card reader family
- `Lexend` italic and bold-italic still use safe fallbacks rather than separate real italic assets
- `Manage Fonts` downloads common SD-card font families from CrossPoint and CPR-vCodex additions, currently `ChareInk` and `Lexend`

## What requires Sync Day

Anything tied to day-level analytics depends on having a valid day reference.

That includes:

- daily goal
- goal streak
- max goal streak
- heatmap
- `today`
- `7D`
- `30D`
- last read date

Recommended rule:

- do `Sync Day` once before reading each day

## Data persistence

`CPR-vCodex` keeps storage compatibility as a first priority.

It does **not** use a database. User state is persisted mainly under `/.crosspoint/`.

Important artifacts include:

- `/.crosspoint/state.json`
- `/.crosspoint/reading_stats.json`
- `/.crosspoint/achievements.json`
- `/.crosspoint/recent.json`
- per-book `bookmarks.bin`, now a versioned Highlights store that retains legacy page bookmarks
- `/exports/stats_exported` for manual Reading Stats export/import
- `/exports/stats_backup_YYYY-MM-DD` for automatic dated Reading Stats backups (every 7 days by default)

### Recovering Reading Stats after 1.5.0.1 or 1.5.0.2

Update to `1.6.0.37-cpr-vcodex` before resetting or deleting any data. In most cases the existing `/.crosspoint/reading_stats.json` will load automatically after the update because the affected releases rejected the file without overwriting it.

If the displayed totals are still incomplete or incorrect, open `Settings > Apps > Reading Stats > Import Reading Stats` and select the newest suitable dated backup under `/exports/stats_backup_YYYY-MM-DD`. Those weekly backups appear directly in the import list and do not need to be renamed. If the only copy is on a computer, place it on the SD card as exactly `/exports/stats_exported` (without a `.json` extension), then import it. Try older dated backups newest-first if necessary, and preserve a copy of the SD card before cleaning or resetting statistics.

This is one of the main reasons the fork was rebuilt on a cleaner upstream-derived base instead of continuing to patch the older fork in place.

## Versioning

Each packaged dev build now keeps the base firmware line and the local flash identity easy to distinguish.

Practical values to look at:

- base firmware line: `CrossPoint Reader 1.6.0`
- current release build style: `1.6.0.37-cpr-vcodex`
- packaged artifact style: `artifacts/<version>-cpr-vcodex.bin`

The incremental `.bNNNN` suffix exists specifically to help distinguish newer flashes from older ones on real hardware.

## Build from source

### Prerequisites

- [pioarduino PlatformIO Core](https://github.com/pioarduino/platformio-core) (`pio`) or `VS Code + pioarduino IDE`
- Python 3.8+
- `clang-format` 21 (for contributor formatting checks)
- USB-C cable supporting data transfer
- Xteink X4 or X3 (ESP32-C3)
- Xteink X3 compatibility has been reported by users, but this maintainer does not have X3 hardware for direct validation

Possible note about X3:

- the codebase may still retain some upstream X3-aware behavior
- the X3-only `Tilt Page Turn` setting is experimental, off by default, and hidden unless the QMI8658 IMU is detected
- `CPR-vCodex` is not validated on X3 hardware
- no X3 device is currently available for testing

### Build

Use the project build wrapper:

```powershell
.\bin\build-vcodex.ps1
```

The wrapper forces UTF-8 Python/console output for PlatformIO on Windows and
uses one build job by default for more repeatable local diagnostics. You can
still pass another environment or job count explicitly:

```powershell
.\bin\build-vcodex.ps1 -Environment gh_release_rc -Jobs 2
```

> [!WARNING]
> X4 Pro release binaries are not published. The source retains an internal
> ESP32-S3 environment for maintainers investigating the hardware, but it is
> not a supported installation path. Do not give local X4 Pro builds to users,
> especially owners of CN/USB-locked units, until a tested recovery procedure
> exists.

To verify the `gh_release` environment locally without advancing the release
counter or rewriting this README:

```powershell
$env:VCODEX_RELEASE_DRY_RUN = "1"
.\bin\build-vcodex.ps1 -Environment gh_release
Remove-Item Env:\VCODEX_RELEASE_DRY_RUN
```

This generates a packaged firmware artifact under:

```text
artifacts/<version>-cpr-vcodex.bin
```

Versioning rules:

- release builds: `1.6.0.<release>-cpr-vcodex.bin`
- dev builds: `1.6.0.<release>.dev<build>-<sha>-cpr-vcodex.bin`
- internal maintainer-only X4 Pro builds carry `-x4pro`; these artifacts must
  not be distributed while the safety withdrawal remains active

Release publishing:

- before tagging, run:

```powershell
python scripts/pre_release_check.py --tag 1.6.0.37-cpr-vcodex
```

- push a stable tag named like `1.6.0.37-cpr-vcodex`
- `pre_release_check.py` dry-runs `gh_release`, checks it against the 6,553,600
  byte X4 OTA slot, validates the artifact pair, and rejects any X4 Pro entry
  or stale X4 Pro browser binary
- the release workflow builds `gh_release` and attaches only `<tag>.bin`, its
  build metadata, and its firmware-budget reports (four assets)
- tagged CI release builds derive the firmware release number from the tag, not
  from a local counter file
- the auto-flash sync workflow mirrors the published C3 release asset into
  `docs/firmware/firmware.bin`, removes any stale `firmware-x4pro.bin`, and
  writes only `devices.x4` and `devices.x3` to the manifest
